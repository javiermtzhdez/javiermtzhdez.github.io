## Knowledge Spillovers and The Evolution of Productivity (JMP)

Firms invest in Research and Development (R&D) to improve their productivity through process and product innovations. However, the intangible capital (knowledge) firms obtain through these R&D investments is subject to dissemination: firms that did not perform the original investment can benefit from the knowledge gained by the R&D-performing firms. Measuring the magnitude and direction of knowledge spillovers is fundamental in understanding the externality effects across the economy. However, their quantification proves elusive as no paper trail or unified framework exists, or there is a lack of network data. In this paper, I extend the non-parametric production function estimator of Gandhi et al. (2020) to account for the effect of knowledge spillovers on the evolution of firm-level productivity. I discuss the measurement of external knowledge and the conditions necessary to identify spillover effects. Using a Spanish panel dataset containing production and R&D variables, I estimate spillovers at the region-industry and industry level, finding heterogeneous returns to R&D and that more productive firms benefit from spillovers. Importantly, in most industries, firms that engage in previous R&D (performers) tend to enjoy higher spillovers than non-performers, highlighting the need for absorptive capacity of firms through R&D investments and the non-performers inability to profit from spillovers.

## Neighborhood-level Crime Deterrence in Mexico City

Do surveillance cameras deter crime? This paper addresses this question by analyzing the Participatory Budget (PB) Program in Mexico City and crime rates at the neighborhood level. The PB program allows neighborhoods to choose how to allocate a percentage of public spending on projects proposed by its inhabitants. I focus on neighborhoods that choose to implement surveillance cameras. I leverage the PB program structure and employ the variation of its associated neighborhood-level expenditures, and I empirically test whether crime rates in neighborhoods that implement cameras are lower. I initially classify crimes following the FBI's UCR categories; then I define additional relevant crime categories. I find that the effect of surveillance cameras on crime — that is, the _camera deterrence effect_ — is not statistically significant at the neighborhood level for most crimes. For other crimes, the estimated coefficient is positive and statistically significant, contrary to what was expected. I check for robustness and find that when including both the lagged value of the crime rate and quadratic terms of the neighborhood observables in the regression, the _camera deterrence effect_ is not statistically significant, with only 'theft from auto' and 'disorderly conduct' positive and statistically significant. Possible hypotheses for this finding are the meager resources assigned to neighborhoods, the lack of active monitoring, or a possibly suboptimal location chosen for the cameras.
