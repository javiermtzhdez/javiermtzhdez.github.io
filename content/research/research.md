## Knowledge Spillovers and The Evolution of Productivity (JMP)

Spillovers arise due to the non-rival, partially excludable nature of knowledge such that nonperforming firms will benefit from R&D investments from other firms. To measure the magnitude and direction of these spillovers, this paper develops an structural econometric estimator where firm-level productivity evolves endogenously with R&D investments and external (to the firm) knowledge are the drivers of interest. Using an unbalanced Spanish panel dataset of manufacturing firms containing production and R&D information, I propose an original measure of technological closeness across firms by leveraging detailed firm-level data. I also calculate the geographical dimension of spillovers through an exponential decay function. With these two spillover-generating variables formed by external (to the firm) knowledge, I extend the Gandhi et al. (2020) production function estimator and recover the law of motion of firm-level productivity. This procedure allows me to account for uncertainty associated not only to the innovation process but also to capture the degree of applicability or sucess in implementing knowledge generated outside of the firm. Furthermore, recovering the law of motion allows me to address the heterogeneity of spillovers effects, and the variation across industries, and the heterogeneity across firms within a given industry. Estimates suggest that spillovers have a key role in determining the evolution of firm-level productivity across time and the difference in productivity across firms and time.

## Neighborhood-level Crime Deterrence in Mexico City

Do surveillance cameras deter crime? This paper addresses this question by analyzing the Participatory Budget (PB) Program in Mexico City and crime rates at the neighborhood level. The PB program allows neighborhoods to choose how to allocate a percentage of public spending on projects proposed by its inhabitants. I focus on neighborhoods that choose to implement surveillance cameras. I leverage the PB program structure and employ the variation of its associated neighborhood-level expenditures, and I empirically test whether crime rates in neighborhoods that implement cameras are lower. I initially classify crimes following the FBI's UCR categories; then I define additional relevant crime categories. I find that the effect of surveillance cameras on crime — that is, the _camera deterrence effect_ — is not statistically significant at the neighborhood level for most crimes. For other crimes, the estimated coefficient is positive and statistically significant, contrary to what was expected. I check for robustness and find that when including both the lagged value of the crime rate and quadratic terms of the neighborhood observables in the regression, the _camera deterrence effect_ is not statistically significant, with only 'theft from auto' and 'disorderly conduct' positive and statistically significant. Possible hypotheses for this finding are the meager resources assigned to neighborhoods, the lack of active monitoring, or a possibly suboptimal location chosen for the cameras.
