Welcome! I am a Ph.D. candidate in Economics at Western University (formerly University of Western Ontario), specializing in Empirical Industrial Organization with a particular interest in spillovers, innovation, R&D investment, and antitrust policy. My research focuses on the effects of knowledge externalities and their measurement. In particular, my job-market paper quantifies spillover effects on firm-level productivity and analyzes their heterogeneity across firms and over time. I am also interested in network economics and causal inference methods.
