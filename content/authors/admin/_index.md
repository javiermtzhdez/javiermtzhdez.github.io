      Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

Welcome! I am a Ph.D. Candidate in Economics at the University of Western Ontario. My interests are Empirical Industrial Organization, Applied Economics and Causal Inference, currently with a focus in R&D investments and spillovers. I am also interested in antitrust/competition policy and the cases within that area.
