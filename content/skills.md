## About Me

Welcome! I am a Ph.D. Candidate in Economics at the University of Western Ontario. My interests are Empirical Industrial Organization, Applied Economics and Causal Inference, currently with a focus in R&D investments and spillovers. I am also interested in antitrust/competition policy and the cases within that area.
